git clone https://github.com/dongjuns/RoadDamageDetector.git
```

Read and use the Dongjuns_IEEE_BDC_GRDD_2020_submission.ipynb    

Here are two ways to evaluate my model.
No.1 is following all the phase. No.2 is using road.tar.gz file.

But there is a complex step to make it clear, so I suggest you just to see No.1,
but use road.tar.gz file easily.

You can go section '1. Let's go with docker' directly.
